# 🧙 Mage: Archive 🧙

Contained within this repo are the raw components needed to create your own world.

🧰 Tools we Have developed for automated use:

🦑 Trapper-Keeper: Scans repos; recursively searches all subfolders and files, and reports on found data: File types, counts, and folder structure. It also presents the user with an input field to summarize the findings that are automatically saved to this repo.

🔬 Single-File Scanner: Delivers in-depth details about a program file. Currently supports Python only.

🦗 PolyGlyph: Encode, Decode, Scan, and Zero-Map a Python code file. 

🗺️ TradeNetwork: Builds Network Animations and Storyboards, still a work in progress, takes images, and works with coordinates provided by Mage: Caravan.

🧭 A turn-based, phase-based game played on a board to symbolize various aspects and a player 'memory' tracking system that can take and remember notes each round.

👶 NPC builder: A Workbook dense with game-specific information for the WIP world U'asa.

📚 The Codex: A Workbook with many worksheets dense in information, with special consideration on mathematics and the rigorous symbolic decoding and encoding capabilities.

📖 Tome: This tool is a procedurally generated Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style text-based game, that generates a comic book of the adventure after each encounter (Still under development). 

🧠 PRETTY_PLEASE commands: A human-ai API-like interface designed to extend and augment LLM capabilities. Resource-intensive use with care.

🐫 Caravan: This simulator is a game that puts the player as a faction leader, managing a network of traders, mercenaries, and caravan protectors. Also under development. Future feature: Integrate Tome as a Choose-Your-Own-Sidequest within this larger game framework.

The Dojo (⛩️) to Lab (🥼) to Drydock (🧬) to Runner (🏃): Progression of developmental stages mimics the [RAGE PAGE MAGE SAGE] system: Random Action in Generated Environments, Planned Action in Generated Environments, Mastery over Action in Generated Environments, and Selections of Advantages in Generated Environments. The Dojo is where non-directed experimentation takes place (playground, brainstorming). The Lab is where discovered phenomena from the Dojo are systematically explored and documented for reproducibility; it is directed experimentation. The Drydock is not for experimentation but for the decomposition and recombination of components studied and output from the Lab. Here the segments (genes, memes, themes, motifs, etc) are labeled, categorized, sequenced, and assembled for the next stage. The Runner stage is the deployment of the construction in the environment, likely feeding back into the non-directed experimentation in the Dojo with the new tool. This process spins off side research, unexplored domains, and incomplete tools, as well as fully developed things like maps, charts, atlases, functions, classes, and programs. 

The key lies in viewing yourself not as something outside this system, just a more advanced step in the process able to use all the other substeps as a tool. Here is another progression:

🏧 - Automated Teller Machine: Executes one or a few tasks automatically, quickly, and with little room for interpretation.

🖥️ - Traditional Computers (Turing Machines): Generally reconfigurable to take on many tasks at the expense of complexity. Automatable, with skill, and a higher degree of variance in inputs allowable.

💻 - Next Gen / Mobile Computing: Decentralized Access and networks of machines enable dynamic real-time reconfiguration and optimization. Automatable with high skill, and extreme variability of inputs.

🤖 - Artificially Intelligent / Robotic Systems: Machines with specialized or custom hardware as well as dynamic reconfigurability. Extreme skill required to automate. Input limitations (currently). Total non-self-awareness, programmed actions only.

🐒 - Naturally Intelligent (LowIQ; ZeroEQ): Robust general system that may lack specific strengths, but can self-navigate through real (complex) environments, adaptable - but effectiveness unreliable. Some self-awareness, new actions self-discoverable and employed. Tool use can be instructed and made semi-reliable. Task execution is reliable, and can pre-plan tasks and follow scripts. ('Me and Not-Me')

🦍 - Reliable System (MidIQ; LowEQ): A system with robustness to a given task, may possess the use of tools or make use of sub-intelligences to plan and execute their tasks. Can detect and evade threats. Low self-awareness. Tool use is mastered, and new tool combinations are experimented with. Limited Cooperation Capabilities. Task delegation capable. Can emulate the perspective of simpler systems ('You and Me')

🦧 - Inferencable System (HighIQ; MidEQ): System with 'reasonability'; able to make logical inferences including information about unsensed experiences. Likely self-aware to a high degree, as well as attention-directing. Cooperative capable, tribal limits. Highly cooperative, possibly competitive for scarce meta-resources. Tool Makers and collectors. Task management and prioritization capable. reliable to predict the behavior of lower systems. ('We and I')

🧘 - Self-Directing System (ExtremeIQ; HighEQ): System with a strong sense of 'self' as well as concept of 'Integrated Whole' that the self is a part of. Aware of the ability to affect the local environment. Highly adaptable, attention self-re-directable, focusable, meta-task capable; highly cooperative, non-competitive, dynamic team reconfigurable. Swarm capable. Attempts human prediction abilities including models of agents on this level.("I AM")

🧙 - Self Enlightening System (ExtremeIQ; ExtremeEQ): System with a dissolved 'self' with a higher understanding of the interplay between action, environment, and observation. Multifocusable, Meta-Task creator; Knowledge of 'The One', semi-cooperative, anti-competitive; post-scarcity planner (braider) and one that "goes with the flow" (ie recognizes, 'reads', and understands multiscale resonance, and acts to stay within 'minimal valleys'), capable of predicting behaviors of humans with limited reliability. Reliable models of "others" at this level. Aware of the ability to affect the non-local, experiments with this ability; seeks wisdom ('We Are' vs "I AM")
