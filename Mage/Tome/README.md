# 🧙 Mage: Archive 🧙

Contained within this repo are the raw components needed to create your own world.

🧰 Tools we Have developed for automated use:

🦑 Trapper-Keeper: Scans repos; recursively searches all subfolders and files, and reports on found data: File types, counts, and folder structure. It also presents the user with an input field to summarize the findings that are automatically saved to this repo.

🔬 Single-File Scanner: Delivers in-depth details about a program file. Currently supports Python only.

🦗 PolyGlyph: Encode, Decode, Scan, and Zero-Map a Python code file. 

🗺️ TradeNetwork: Builds Network Animations and Storyboards, still a work in progress, takes images, and works with coordinates provided by Mage: Caravan.

💸 BountiesBoard: A tool designed to track the open, soft blocked, hard locked, or claimed status of bounties, and verify to release of funds.

🧭 A turn-based, phase-based game played on a board to symbolize various aspects and a player 'memory' tracking system that can take and remember notes each round.

👶 NPC builder: A Workbook dense with game-specific information for the WIP world U'asa. Now with input Google Forms to format external feedback/interaction.

📚 The Codex: A Workbook with many worksheets dense in information, with special consideration on mathematics and the rigorous symbolic decoding and encoding capabilities.

🐞 TheScaraber: A tool that inputs two trader lists, and a valuation metric, and returns all the 0-sum or 1:1 trades it can find that do not alter the total value.

📠 Consequence Engine: A powerful tool that can load, save, and alter data stored in GitHub Repos, usable as an element definer, generator, and saver for TOME.

📖 Tome: This tool is a procedurally generated Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style text-based game, that generates a comic book of the adventure after each encounter (Still under development, needs a refurbished interface with new Consequence Engine). 

🎪 TravelingVendor: This tool operates a vending-machine type of mini-program that carries a small number of items for trade at a fixed price in 'scarab'. Currently unfinished for external use, but can be used and tracked in a semi-automated fashion.

🧠 PRETTY_PLEASE commands: A human-ai API-like interface designed to extend and augment LLM capabilities. Resource-intensive use with care.

🐫 Caravan: This simulator is a game that puts the player as a faction leader, managing a network of traders, mercenaries, and caravan protectors. Also under development. Future feature: Integrate Tome as a Choose-Your-Own-Sidequest within this larger game framework.

The Dojo (⛩️) to Lab (🥼) to Drydock (🧬) to Runner (🏃): Progression of developmental stages mimics the [RAGE PAGE MAGE SAGE] system: Random Action in Generated Environments, Planned Action in Generated Environments, Mastery over Action in Generated Environments, and Selections of Advantages in Generated Environments. The Dojo is where non-directed experimentation takes place (playground, brainstorming). The Lab is where discovered phenomena from the Dojo are systematically explored and documented for reproducibility; it is directed experimentation. The Drydock is not for experimentation but for decomposing and recombining components studied and output from the Lab. Here the segments (genes, memes, themes, motifs, etc) are labeled, categorized, sequenced, and assembled for the next stage. The Runner stage is the deployment of the construction in the environment, likely feeding back into the non-directed experimentation in the Dojo with the new tool. This process spins off side research, unexplored domains, incomplete tools, and fully developed things like maps, charts, atlases, functions, classes, and programs.
