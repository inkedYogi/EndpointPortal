    /*
    To create a knowledge flow calculator, you'll need the following variables and equations:
    
    Variables:
    
    faction_relationship_matrix: A matrix representing the relationships between factions, with continuous values in the range [-1, 1]. Each element (i, j) in the matrix represents the relationship between Faction i and Faction j.
    
    faction_languages: A data structure (e.g., dictionary) containing the primary and secondary languages spoken by each faction.
    
    k: Apositive constant that determines the steepness of the sigmoid function used for calculating the knowledge-sharing probability.
    
    language_compatibility_matrix: A matrix representing the compatibility between different languages. Each element (i, j) in the matrix represents the compatibility between Language i and Language j, with values between 0 (no common language) and 1 (same language).
    
    scroll_exchange_factors: A set of factors related to the scroll exchange process, such as scroll quality, encryption, and expertise of the receiving faction in deciphering the scroll. These factors can be represented as a data structure (e.g., dictionary) with appropriate weights or multipliers.
    
    Equations:
    
    Knowledge-sharing probability:
    knowledge_sharing_probability = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * faction_relationship_value))
    
    where faction_relationship_value is an element from the faction_relationship_matrix.
    
    Language compatibility:
    language_compatibility = language_compatibility_matrix[language_i][language_j]
    
    where language_i and language_j are the languages of the interacting factions, and language_compatibility_matrix is the precomputed matrix of language compatibility values.
    
    Knowledge transfer function:
    knowledge_transfer = knowledge_sharing_probability * language_compatibility * scroll_exchange_factors
    */
