# Proposal for Multivector Operations

This file contains the proposed methods to be implemented in the Multivector class. These methods enable the mathematical operations on Multi-vectors.

- Geometric Product

- Inner Product


- Outer Product


- Dual


- Inverse

- Reflection

- Rotation

- Translation

- Interpolation

- Derivative

- Integral

After the approval of these proposals, they will be integrated into the full library file.
