A = a0 + a1e1 + ... + anen
B = b0 + b1e1 + ... + bnen

For multivectors A and B, and scalar k:

Addition: A + B = (a0+b0) + (a1+b1)e1 + ... + (an+bn)en
Subtraction: A - B = (a0-b0) + (a1-b1)e1 + ... + (an-bn)en
Inner Product: a ⋅ b or ⟨a, b⟩ = (ab + ba)/2
Outer Product: A ⊗ B or A ∧ B = (ab - ba)/2
Norm: ||A|| = sqrt(A~A), where ~A is the reverse of A
Normalization: A/||A||
Scaling: kA = ka0 + ka1e1 + ... + kanen
Geometric Product: AB = A ⋅ B + A ∧ B
Dual: a*
Inverse: a⁻¹
Reflection of v across A: Refₙ(v) = 
Rotation: Rotₙ(θ, v)
Translation: Transₜ(v)
Interpolation: interp(v₁, v₂, t)
Derivative: d/dx a or ∇a
Integral: ∫a

Further implementations will be proposed and appended to the proposal file. After approval of the proposals, they will be integrated into the full library file.
