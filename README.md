Three Wishes - Priority Actions
1. Develop and Test Mage: Trivial
Steps to Build a Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
[🌟, (Create), {Write New Code}]: Initiate the coding process by setting up the basic game environment in Processing.
[🧪, (Test), {Run Code Tests}]: Implement unit tests to validate individual components.
[☢, (Enhance), {Improve Code Base}]: Optimize the code and add essential features based on initial testing.
[🍄, (Integrate), {Integrate Code Base}]: Combine the optimized subroutines and test the integrated system.
[🤝, (Report), {Give Status Update}]: Document the development process, challenges, and successes.
Testing Strategy
Unit Testing: Test individual components for functionality.
Integration Testing: Test the interaction between integrated components.
User Acceptance Testing: Validate the game with real users to ensure it meets requirements.
2. Refine Collaboration Process
ChatGPT and PDF Reader AI Query Formulation
Query Initialization: Use a 📋 process to formulate initial queries.
Query Refinement: Utilize ChatGPT's 📚 accumulated knowledge and the PDF reader AI's capabilities to refine the queries.
Query Execution: Execute the refined queries and gather data.
Feedback Loop: Use the data to further refine future queries.
3. Implement Gradual Integration Strategy
Phase 1: Integrate basic game mechanics.
Phase 2: Integrate AI components, such as ChatGPT and PDF reader AI.
Phase 3: Perform 🧪 tests on the fully integrated system.
Phase 4: Roll out the integrated system for user acceptance testing.
