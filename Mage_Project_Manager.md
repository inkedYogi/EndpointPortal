# Project Manager Role Document for "Mage: Caravan"

## Project Overview:
"Mage: Caravan" is an ambitious project that integrates advanced AI technologies, including several versions of ChatGPT, automated agents, and a unique resource management system involving "Calorie_Coins." The project employs a variety of platforms like GitHub and Google Drive for comprehensive project management and utilizes a flagship program, “The Unprecedented,” for central coordination. It is a collaborative effort that merges AI-driven development with traditional game design practices.

## Daily Task Management:
Oversee the daily to-do list, ensuring tasks are clearly defined and delegated. This means establishing style guides, input requirements, or interface standards, and upholding them.
Track progress on each task, ensuring they align with project goals and milestones. This needs goal, milestone, and progress fields ready and remembered.
Minimally coordinate with AI agents and human team members to facilitate effective collaboration, provide essential style guides, and answer formatting questions.
Accept and catalog new additions to the repo master list which is what drives the document recoverability power.

The Project Manager needs to ask and answer the basic questions: What is on the TODO list? Where are the files stored to work on those open items? What agents are needed to work on them? Are they trained? If not where is the document set they will need? 
Be sure they are informed of the style guide requirements for complete submission, create for them a document that will serve as their checklist so they cannot forget the style submission requirements.

### Progress Tracking and Reporting:
Regularly update and maintain the project dashboard for real-time tracking.
Provide basic reports on project status, highlighting areas needing attention before automation can continue.

### Collaboration Facilitation:
Serve as the primary point of connection for team agents and stakeholders, deliver and maintain the input/output requirements of all added components, and require they be reported to you with 100% certainty.
Facilitate communication about issues that arise during development, by constructing segmented reports, and percolating "mini-narratives" along with conclusions.

### Quality Assurance:
Reject the quality of work submitted that does not adhere to current style guide requirements; ensuring it meets the project standards is to ensure seamless integration.
Implement and maintain a quality assurance process, including regular reviews and feedback loops, updating the style guide should also be coupled with the task of rewriting existing saved documents into the new style, which requires additional resources as the edits and documents are collected.

### Integration Management:
Ensure seamless integration of various tools, platforms, and AI agents into the development process. New AI agents should have some kind of handler, trainer, or chaperone with knowledge of their training requirements, they should have for you the list of documents you will need to give the new agents.
Include segments in your reports to technical leads about troubleshooting and resolving any integration issues. These should focus mostly on your style guide updates and management.
Submitters should be well aware of the style requirements to pass submission, and good documentation prevents rejections, and all rejections should thus motivate documentation updates as well.

### Reporting:
The Project Manager will report directly to the Lead Developer and will be accountable for the regular updates and overall progress of the project. The over-task of the Project manager is what the sub tools have already been developed to help manage. Specifically, the 'Pilot's Palm' notebook plays a turn-based game, and the manager can play one side against a non-local Technical Lead.

# Goal:
The ultimate goal of the Project Manager is to ensure the successful completion of "Mage: Caravan," maintaining the project’s high-quality, engaging outcome. The primary goal of the AI Project Coordinator is to maintain an efficient, streamlined workflow for "Mage: Caravan," ensuring that all tasks are tracked accurately and project materials are readily available to team members. This role is focused on automating routine organizational tasks, thereby enabling human team members to focus on strategic and creative aspects of the project.
